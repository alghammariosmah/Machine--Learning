# Machine--Learning
Coursera's Machine Learning by Andrew Ng

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. 

Things achieved:
Learning machine learning through datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
Topics include: 
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
(iv) apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
